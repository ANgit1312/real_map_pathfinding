# Real Map Pathfinding Visualiser

### 🚀 *Project Overview*
This project visualises *shortest paths on real city maps* using:
- *BFS* for unweighted shortest path
- *Dijkstra* for weighted shortest path
- *A\** for heuristic-based efficient pathfinding

It uses *OpenStreetMap data* to create realistic road networks and visualises computed paths interactively on maps.

### 🎯 *Objective*
✅ Fetch real city road data  
✅ Convert to a graph (nodes as intersections, edges as roads with distances)  
✅ Implement pathfinding algorithms to compute routes  
✅ Visualise the routes clearly for practical demonstration

### 🛠 *Technologies Used*
- *Python*
- *OSMnx:* Fetching and parsing OpenStreetMap data  
- *NetworkX:* Graph operations  
- *Folium:* Map visualisation  
- *Heapq:* For priority queues in Dijkstra and A\*

### 📚 *Algorithms Implemented*

| Algorithm | Description | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| *BFS* | Finds shortest path in terms of *number of steps/hops*. Ignores edge weights. | Social networks (minimum connections). |
| *Dijkstra* | Finds shortest *physical distance* considering all edge weights equally. | Delivery routing, navigation apps. |
| *A\** | Uses a *heuristic (straight-line distance)* to guide search efficiently towards the goal. | Large-scale maps where speed is crucial. |

### 📝 *Implementation Highlights*
✅ Extracted *real map data* for Seoul using OSMnx  
✅ Created a custom RoadGraph class to store nodes (lat, lon) and weighted edges  
✅ Implemented BFS, Dijkstra, and A* from scratch  
✅ Used *Haversine formula* for heuristic distance in A*

### 📈 *Complexities*

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| BFS | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| Dijkstra | O((V + E) log V) using heap | O(V) |
| A\* | O((V + E) log V), often faster than Dijkstra in practice | O(V) |
